# summary
In the project we analise two csv files and create a datafre for all data,
then we proceed to make a detail analysis based on Distric Data,
School Data, Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing),
Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing), Math Scores by Grade, 
Reading Score by Grade, Scores by School Spending, Scores by School Size and 
Scores by School Type to have a solid understand of the average for math and reading sunjects
also to get a better understand of the budget for every school and the succesfull pass rate of student. 

# Conclusion

* For School Size between 1000-2000 students there are the must % Passing for each subject 
either the Score is dosent show a big diference than school size smaller than 1000 students.

* In the case of buget / spending per student we find that there are better results 
for % Passing for each subject than for cases where the spending ranges is $645-$680,
the must notice data in this is that the average in math score is almost 10 solid point in comparison.
